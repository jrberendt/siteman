# siteman
Simple local site editor and manager <br/>
Under construction at the moment and only includes very basic operations like creating a file from template. Still useful to me, and more features will be added in the future.
## How to use
To start, I execute this script from a variable like $siteman instead of keeping it in the directory my website is in. That way I don't upload it to my webserver. <br/>
Make sure to execute "siteman p {YOUR_WEBSITE_PATH}" and "siteman s" to set everything up correctly. Then, look at the help menu by just executing the script without arguments.
